# Joeyonng's Backyard

This repository houses the source code of Joeyonng's personal backyard, and it is live on https://joeyonng.github.io/.

As time goes by, I will throw more features, applications and maybe personal stories to my backyard.

## Why macOS Big Sur?

In case you haven't noticed, this site is trying to mimic the UI of macOS Big Sur since I always appreciate the design
of macOS.

This site is still in an early development and is far from a perfect copy of the real desktop experience (also lots of 
bugs), but I already got lots of joys developing it. 

Although I am not a professionally trained frontend developer, I enjoy learning 
frontend development while building this project.

## Development

- Single-page-application (SPA) developed using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/).
- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
- Most of the animations are developed using [React Spring](https://react-spring.io/) and other simple ones are covered 
  by CSS animations.
- Static [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) and dynamic inline styles used as styling solutions.
- This awesome [Figma](https://products.ls.graphics/macos/) UI kit and my girlfriend's 2015 
  Macbook Air as the design references.

If you liked the design of my backyard, please also check out these awesome repositories which are very helpful.
- The idea is heavily inspired by [winXP](https://github.com/ShizukuIchi/winXP), from which I learned how to switch 
  different Apps. 
- It turns that I am not the first one to think of implementing web based macOS Big Sur UI.
  [macos-web](https://github.com/PuruVJ/macos-web) and [playground-macos](https://github.com/Renovamen/playground-macos)
  are two finner, more efficient and more professional implementations of the same idea.
- The dock is adapted from [react-osx-dock](https://github.com/lukehorvat/react-osx-dock). I never thought state can be
used to do the animations frame by frame.
